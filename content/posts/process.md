I've never really had a blog. 

I've started a few, mostly as an exercise in exploring different publishing frameworks. 
Nothing ever really sticks. It seems as though it's often a pretty pointless endeavor. Who will read it? 
Who has the time to keep it going? Do I even have anything worth talking about?

Here's another crack at it. I plan on posting things that I've been working on and thinking about here.
Some of it may be interesting to others, a good amount of it will not. The goal is to keep things simple and to maintain momentum. Ultimately, for me, the exercise is about accountability -- 
I want to work on more things consistently, and I want to improve my writing -- better yet -- if somebody else finds value that's a bonus!

This space is intended to be a place to hone a process. To start that process (shamelessly borrowed from [@JamesClear](https://twitter.com/jamesclear) is roughly:

1. Explore widely. Find out what is possible.
2. Test cheaply. Run small, quick experiments. Sample things.
3. Edit ruthlessly. Focus on the best. Cut everything else.
4. Repeat what works. Don't quit on a good idea.
5. Repeat 1 

### Places to explore

* [Decentralized Web](https://flyingzumwalt.gitbooks.io/decentralized-web-primer/content/) or Web3: Exploring things like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) (which is what currently hosts this blog), [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/anatomy/), etc.
* Optimized learning: building a [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), and organizing thought using tools like [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/)
* Building: Tools to help connect people to their community, food supply chains, nature.
* Baking: specifically bagels. Is the perfect bagel possible?
* Automation: Creating tools and processes to make testing ideas cheap and easy. Optimizing the path from 0 to 1.
